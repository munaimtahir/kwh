_Last updated: 2025-09-25 18:37_

**What it is:** An Android app to log electricity meter readings per meter, view trends, and receive reminder notifications to enter new readings.

**Who it’s for:** Anyone who wants a simple, offline meter log (home, office, lab rooms) with local persistence and gentle reminders.

**How it works (in simple steps):**
1. Create one or more **meters** (e.g., “Home Main”, “Clinic Lab”).
2. Set an optional **reminder** for each meter (frequency in days + time).
3. When the reminder arrives, open the app and **add a reading** (number + optional note).
4. See the **latest reading** for each meter; view **history** and **trends** (line chart).
5. **Export to CSV** to share or archive your data. (No cloud required; all local.)

**What it does *not* do (intentionally):**
- No online sync or accounts (privacy-first MVP).
- No automatic OCR/vision from photos (could be a future enhancement).
