# Deployment Readiness Review

## Summary
- `MeterReminderWorker` now references `thresholdForecast` when composing threshold warnings, resolving the undefined identifier that previously prevented compilation.
- `HistoryViewModel` refreshes `billingAnchorDay` and `thresholdsCsv` from the active meter overview and after CSV imports, so exports reflect the latest configuration.

## Outstanding Concerns
- Android SDK is not provisioned in this environment, so the Gradle build fails locally. Ensure CI or release builds run with a configured SDK.
